 What else can you do with Node Packages? You can build off of other people's code and let other people use yours as well!
 What else can you do with Express? I'm sure there is lots I could do, I'm hoping we will learn more about what that will be.
 What other technologies could you use instead of Express? Another couple technologies I saw while researching are Fastify and Koa.
 How is hosting in Express different than how you've hosted before? It all lives on our own device, there is nothing on a 'secondary' site.
