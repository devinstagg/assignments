Throughout this assignment we've used NPM Package and Node Module as if they are the same, while there are similarities, how do they differ from one another? From what I understand, modules are some code to help you accomplish something while a package is typically a group of modules together.
If you create a new Node Module, how do you share that code with the community? You can put it on Github or on the npmjs.com website! But I would love to learn more about this...
