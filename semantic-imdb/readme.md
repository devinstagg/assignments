# Semantic IMDB

## Question 1: Why should we structure HTML semantically for something like a login form?
Structuring a login form semantically allows someone who is visually impaired to completely understand where they can sign up. Additionally, it helps create clarity.

## Question 2: What are some benefits of everyone using similar semantic HTML?
It can create a very clear way for search engines to start understanding websites more holistically and giving back better results for queries.

## Question 3: What are some disadvantages? 
Based on some articles I read, semantic isnâ€™t all the way fleshed out and can cause issues for older browsers.
